# FDF - Wireframe Model Project 🌍🖼️

### Disclaimer 🚫⚠️
This project can't be Dockerized due to OS-specific   dependencies of MiniLibX. Please run it locally for the   best experience.   
  
## Overview 📜

FDF is a graphical project focused on creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape 🏞️. The project entails linking various points (x, y, z) through line segments to form a landscape model.

## Objectives 🎯

The main objective of this project is to create a 3D representation of a landscape using wireframe modeling 📐. This involves managing graphic elements, handling user inputs 🕹️, and effectively rendering the landscape in 3D.

## Features 🌟

- **Rendering in Isometric Projection**: The project renders the wireframe landscape model in isometric projection for a 3D view 📏.
- **File Parsing**: Ability to read and interpret `.fdf` files, which contain the coordinates of the landscape 🗺️.
- **Graphic Management**: Utilizes MiniLibX, an internal school graphical library, for window management and graphic rendering 🖌️.
- **Interactive Controls**: Allows users to interact with the model using keyboard.
